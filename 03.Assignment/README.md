# 🌟 Assignment 3 - Programming Fundamentals 🌟

Welcome to **Assignment 3** in my Programming Fundamentals journey! 🎉 Here, I dive into real-world coding challenges using essential concepts like **nested if-else**, **logical operators**, and **switch statements**. These programs aren't just code—they’re mini-solutions to common, everyday scenarios! 🌍

## 🚀 Task Overview

### 1. 📐 Admission Eligibility Checker
**Goal:** Determine if a student is eligible for admission—and maybe even a scholarship! Checks if they meet the minimum 50% or the 80% threshold for a scholarship.

### 2. 🔌 Electricity Bill Calculator
Calculate electricity costs based on usage:
- **Up to 100 units:** Free ⚡
- **101-200 units:** ₹5 per unit
- **201-300 units:** ₹8 per unit
- **Above 300 units:** ₹10 per unit 💡

### 3. ❤️ Blood Donation Eligibility
Are you ready to save lives? This program checks **age** and **weight** to determine if you’re eligible to donate blood. 🩸

### 4. 💸 Income Tax Calculator
No one loves taxes, but this program simplifies the process:
- **Up to ₹250,000:** 0% tax 🌱
- **₹250,001 - ₹500,000:** 5%
- **₹500,001 - ₹1,000,000:** 10%
- **Above ₹1,000,000:** 15% 🏦

### 5. 🏧 Bank ATM Withdrawal Eligibility
This program checks if a customer can make a withdrawal, with a twist for amounts over ₹10,000: a special withdrawal permit is needed! 💳

### 6. 📊 Student Grade with Pass/Fail Status
Input marks for three subjects to calculate the average, grade, and pass/fail status. Are you on the honor roll with an **A**? 🎖️

### 7. 🛒 Online Shopping Discount System
Shop smart! For purchases above ₹2000:
- **Members** get a 20% discount
- **Non-members** get 10%
- For amounts below ₹2000, no discount but maybe next time! 😉

### 8. 🩺 Health Insurance Eligibility
See if someone qualifies for health insurance:
- Above 18? Check!
- If above 45, any serious illness disqualifies the applicant.

### 9. 📅 Day of the Week Determiner
Enter a number (1-7) and find out the day of the week— with a friendly "Invalid input" for numbers outside that range! 📆

### 10. 💵 Loan Approval System
Want to know if you qualify for a loan? This program checks **monthly income** and **existing loan status** (no overdue payments allowed).

## 🔧 Concepts in Action
- **Nested if-else**: Making complex decisions easy.
- **Logical operators**: Combining conditions for precise checks.
- **Relational operators**: Comparing values to match real-world scenarios.
- **Switch statements**: Streamlining selection of days based on numbers.

## 🎉 Getting Started

Each program file is standalone—simply compile with a C compiler and follow on-screen prompts. It’s easy to explore each program one at a time, seeing how they address unique problems with smart, logical solutions!
