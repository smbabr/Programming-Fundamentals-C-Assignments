# Assignment No 2: Fun with Programming! 🎉

Welcome to **Assignment No 2**, where we explore some exciting programming challenges! This collection of projects will help you strengthen your coding skills and have a bit of fun along the way. Let's dive into these creative tasks! 🌟

## 1. Basic Calculator 🧮
Create a simple program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. Users will input two numbers along with an operator (+, -, *, /), and your program will deliver the result. 

## 2. Even or Odd Checker 🔢
This program will ask the user for a number and determine whether it's even or odd. A quick check that helps practice your coding logic!

## 3. Eligibility for Voting 🗳️
Develop a program that asks for a person's age and checks if they are eligible to vote (age must be 18 or above). This project is a great way to practice age-related conditions!

## 4. Find the Largest Number 🌐
In this task, your program will take three numbers as input and identify which one is the largest. It's a fantastic exercise in comparison!

## 5. Temperature Converter 🌡️
Create a program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The formulas are:
- **Fahrenheit = (Celsius × 9/5) + 32**
- **Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) × 5/9**

## 6. Grade Calculator 🎓
This program will ask for marks in three subjects, calculate the average, and print a grade based on specified conditions. A great way to integrate user input with decision-making!

## 7. Discount Calculator 🛒
Write a program that takes a shopping total and applies discounts based on defined criteria. This task enhances your understanding of conditional logic in real-world applications!

## 8. Leap Year Checker 🌈
Determine if a given year is a leap year or not by checking specific conditions. This task is a great way to practice your understanding of modulo operations!

## 9. Simple Interest Calculator 💰
Create a program that calculates simple interest using the formula:  
**Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100**  
This will help you practice using arithmetic operations effectively.

## 10. Login System 🔑
Design a simple login system that prompts the user for a username and password. If the user inputs the correct credentials, they will see a success message; otherwise, they will receive a failure message. A great introduction to string comparison!
