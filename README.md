# Programming Fundamentals - C Language 🌟

Welcome to my Programming Fundamentals repository! This collection showcases my journey through the core concepts of C programming as part of my semester coursework. Here, I explore essential coding techniques and solve a range of problems that strengthen my grasp of the C language.

## 📁 Repository Overview

This repository includes all my assignments in C, organized by topic to reflect my learning progress. Each assignment dives into a specific programming concept and demonstrates how these concepts come together to build functional, efficient, and logical solutions.

## 📜 Topics Covered

Here’s a quick look at some of the topics I’ve covered:

- **Basic Input & Output**: Using `printf` and `scanf` for basic user interactions.
- **Control Structures**: Mastering `if-else`, `switch`, and loops to control program flow.
- **Functions**: Writing reusable blocks of code to keep things clean and organized.
- **Arrays and Pointers**: Getting hands-on with data structures and memory management.
- **Operators**: Arithmetic, relational, and logical operators that make the magic happen.

## 📂 Assignments

Each assignment folder is clearly labeled (e.g., `Assignment no 1`, `Assignment no 2`, etc.) and contains a README describing the objectives and concepts behind each task. The assignments range from simple calculations to more complex logic-based problems, with each task pushing my understanding of C a little further.

## 🚀 Highlights

- **Engaging Examples**: Practical examples that relate coding theory to real-world applications.
- **Problem Solving**: Code that focuses on problem-solving skills to build logical thinking.
- **Modularity and Readability**: Code that’s organized, well-documented, and easy to read.

## 🎯 Goals

This repository aims to serve as a reference for my growth in programming and to be a helpful resource for anyone starting with C. Feel free to explore, fork, or even contribute to the code if you’re interested!
