## 🔍 Program Overviews

### Program 1: Sum of Two Integers
A straightforward program that calculates the sum of two integers entered by the user.

### Program 2: Square of an Integer
Calculates the square of a given integer—an excellent way to explore multiplication and variable usage.

### Program 3: Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion
This program converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, introducing basic arithmetic and type handling.

### Program 4: Fahrenheit to Celsius Conversion
Similar to Program 3, but in reverse! This one converts temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

## 💡 Concepts Used

- **Input and Output**: Uses `scanf` and `printf` functions to interact with the user, making each program interactive and responsive.
- **Variables**: Declares and initializes variables like integers and floats to store data and calculation results effectively.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Implements core operations (addition, multiplication) for basic calculations and data manipulation.
- **Data Types**: Demonstrates the difference between integer and floating-point types, which is essential for precise computations.
- **C Program Structure**: Each program adheres to the fundamental structure of a C program, showcasing the `main` function, variable declarations, and return types.
