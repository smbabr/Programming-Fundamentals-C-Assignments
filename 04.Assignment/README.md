# Assignment No. 4: Programming Tasks 🎓

## Overview

This directory  contains five programming assignments aimed at enhancing programming skills through practical applications. Each program is designed to address a specific scenario, using fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and data analysis. The assignments are as follows:

1. **Digital Step Counter** 🏃‍♂️
2. **Budget Tracker for Daily Expenses** 💰
3. **Password Strength Checker** 🔒
4. **Temperature Analysis for Weather App** 🌡️
5. **Online Study Hours Tracker** 📚

## 1. Digital Step Counter 🏃‍♂️

### Scenario
You’re creating a simple fitness step counter for a smartwatch. Every hour, the smartwatch records the number of steps taken. At the end of the day, the device analyzes the step data.

### Problem Statement
Write a program that takes the number of steps for each hour (24 inputs) and calculates:
- Total steps taken in the day.
- Average steps per hour.
- The hour with the maximum and minimum steps.

### Requirements
- Use a for loop to input and analyze data.
- Use variables to track the total, average, and peak hours.

### Challenge
Display a message if there’s any hour with no steps recorded (indicating inactivity).

## 2. Budget Tracker for Daily Expenses 💰

### Scenario
A student is tracking their daily expenses over a week to manage their budget. They want to understand which days they’re overspending.

### Problem Statement
Write a program that:
- Takes daily spending amounts as input for 7 days.
- Calculates the total weekly spending and average daily spending.
- Checks if any day’s spending exceeds a user-defined daily budget limit and flags that day as “Overspent.”

### Requirements
- Use a for loop to input expenses and analyze each day.

### Challenge
Calculate how much over the budget the user was for any “Overspent” day and provide an overall spending summary.

## 3. Password Strength Checker 🔒

### Scenario
A company wants to ensure employees are creating strong passwords. A password is considered “strong” if it’s at least 8 characters long, contains both uppercase and lowercase letters, and includes at least one numeric digit.

### Problem Statement
Write a program that repeatedly prompts the user to enter a password until a strong password is provided.

### Requirements
- Use a while loop to repeatedly check if the password meets the criteria.
- Use conditional statements to validate each rule.

### Challenge
After each failed attempt, provide feedback on what the password is missing (length, case, or digits).

## 4. Temperature Analysis for Weather App 🌡️

### Scenario
A weather app collects temperature data for each day of a month and needs to analyze trends to give users insights into temperature changes.

### Problem Statement
Write a program that takes 30 temperature readings (one for each day of the month) and calculates:
- The average monthly temperature.
- The highest and lowest temperature recorded.
- Days where the temperature was above the average.

### Requirements
- Use a for loop to input temperature data and calculate the average, max, and min.

### Challenge
List the days with temperatures above average and indicate “Hot Days” if the temperature was above 35°C.

## 5. Online Study Hours Tracker 📚

### Scenario
A student wants to track their study hours daily to see if they’re meeting their weekly study goals.

### Problem Statement
Write a program that:
- Asks the student to enter their study hours for each day of the week (7 inputs).
- Calculates the total study hours for the week.
- Checks if they met the minimum weekly goal of 35 hours and prints a motivational message if they fall short.

### Requirements
- Use a for loop to input daily hours and calculate the weekly total.

### Challenge
If they study over 10 hours on any single day, print “Warning: Burnout Alert!”
